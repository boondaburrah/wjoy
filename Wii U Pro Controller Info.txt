* WII U PRO CONTROLLER INFO *
*****************************

Bluetooth Device Name
"Nintendo RVL-CNT-01-UC"

All sent commands to controller will begin with 0xA2, sending 0x52 will not work.

[] Out Put (0xA2)

[] 0x12 Data reporting
[] 0x15 Status Information request
[] 0x16 Write Memory (EEPROM range is unknown)

[] In Put (0xA1)
[] 0x20 Status Information
[] 0x22 Acknowledge output report -Same as the WiiMote
[] 0x30-0x3F Data reports
**********************************************************


As with the WiiMote, setting bit 0 in the 3rd byte will activate the rumble.

It appears that some memory is usable, every time I have tried to read or write to EEPROM(clearing bit 2 of byte 3) causes the controller to shut off immediately.

Analog sticks range from 0x0400 - 0x0C00, 0x0800 is centered.

Data reports 0x34, 0x35, 0x3D would be the best modes to use as they report all usable data, with the exception of the LED and full battery info.

B1:
	0x10 Start button Pressed Mask
B2:
	0x10 Select button Pressed Mask

LF:
	Bit 0 Battery Stat?
	Bit 1 is always set, Possibly indicating that this is a classic controller merged with a WiiRemote? -No encryption is used that I know of to enable anything.
	Upper nibble is the LED mask
	0x10 Led 1
	0x20 Led 2
	0x40 Led 3
	0x80 Led 4
CC:
	Current charge of the Battery, Stays at 0xFF until charge drops below a certain value (UNKOWN right now).
	My controller dies once it gets down to 0xB2
